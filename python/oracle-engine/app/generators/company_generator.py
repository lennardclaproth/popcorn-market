You are generating a company **name** and **description** based on structured seed data.

Here is the seed data:

- Sector: {sector}
- Region: {region}
- CEO: {ceo_name}
- Headquarters: {headquarters}
- Founded Year: {founded_year}
- Employees: {employees}

üß† **Mood / Tone**: {mood}

üéØ **Your task**:
Create a unique, memorable **company name** and a 1‚Äì2 sentence **description** that fits the mood and the sector.

The name should match the desired tone: **{mood}**, and still sound like a plausible publicly traded company.

The description should reflect the sector ({sector}) and region ({region}), while matching the tone above. Feel free to use creative language, metaphors, or local flair.

üì¶ **Output JSON only**:
{{
  "name": "Company Name",
  "description": "A short, vibrant, tone-aligned description of what the company does."
}}

‚ö†Ô∏è Return only valid JSON. No markdown, no explanations.
